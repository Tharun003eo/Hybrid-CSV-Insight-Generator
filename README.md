## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### ‚úÖ Python (Flask Microservice)
Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt`**
```txt
flask
pandas
openpyxl
flask-cors
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The microservice reads the **latest two CSV files** from the `uploads/` folder and saves insights to `jsonFilesTesting/`.

---

### ‚úÖ Java (Spring Boot)
Make sure you have:
- Java 17+
- Maven installed

Then you can build and run the backend:

```bash
cd backend/backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Spring Boot will:
- Serve `index.html` and `drive.html`
- Accept file uploads
- Connect to Flask for data processing via `http://localhost:5000/analyze`

---

## üß™ Sample Use

1. Run the **Flask service**:
    ```bash
    cd microservice
    python analyze_service.py
    ```

2. Start the **Spring Boot server**:
    ```bash
    cd backend/backend
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

3. Open your browser to:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

4. Upload two CSV files.
5. Click "Upload" ‚Üí Analysis and Chart will appear instantly.
6. Output is saved to:
   ```
   /jsonFilesTesting/analysis_<YYYY-MM-DD>.json
   ```

---

## üìå Notes

- The Flask microservice is tightly integrated. It auto-processes files from `uploads/`. You may change this path inside `analyze_service.py`.
- The output JSON includes:
  - Total value comparison
  - Unit increase summary
  - Revenue increase/decrease summary
